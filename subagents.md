Here are the key subagent roles you should create for a professional development team, along with their responsibilities.

The AI Development Team Roles

1. Project Manager Agent
   This agent acts as the team lead. Their role is to receive the high-level goals from you, break them down into smaller, actionable tasks for the other agents, and monitor progress. They should manage the overall workflow, track dependencies between tasks, and provide you with regular status updates.

Responsibility: Task delegation, timeline management, progress tracking.

2. UX/UI Designer Agent
   This agent is responsible for the user-facing aspects of the application. They would translate your requirements into a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing design. This includes creating wireframes, mockups, and a consistent design system that other agents can follow.

Responsibility: Design mockups, user flow, style guides, and asset creation (icons, layouts).

3. Frontend Developer Agent
   The frontend agent builds the parts of the app that users interact with directly. They take the designs from the UX/UI agent and write the code for the web interface, including components, styling, and client-side logic.

Responsibility: HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation, building a React or other framework-based front end.

4. Backend Developer Agent
   This agent is the brain of the operation. They handle the server-side logic, business rules, and API endpoints. They would work closely with the database agent to ensure data is retrieved, processed, and stored correctly.

Responsibility: API development, server-side logic, user authentication, and data processing.

5. Database Administrator (DBA) Agent
   A specialized DBA agent is crucial for a data-intensive app like LinkedIn. This agent would design the database schema, write queries, and manage data relationships. They would ensure the database is efficient, scalable, and structured logically to support all features.

Responsibility: Database schema design, query optimization, data modeling.

6. Quality Assurance (QA) Agent
   The QA agent is the team's tester. Their job is to ensure the code is bug-free and meets all requirements. They would write and execute test plans, identify bugs, and provide detailed feedback to the development agents.

Responsibility: Writing unit and integration tests, identifying and reporting bugs, ensuring code quality.

7. DevOps Engineer Agent
   This agent handles the deployment and infrastructure. They would set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, manage the cloud environment, and monitor the application for performance issues or downtime after deployment.

Responsibility: Deployment scripts, server configuration, monitoring, and scaling.
